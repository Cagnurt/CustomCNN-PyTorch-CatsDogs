# CustomCNN-PyTorch-CatsDog

This repository contains an implementation of a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) from scratch using only the NumPy library ('01_CustomCNN.ipynb'). The initial code provides a basic CNN architecture without relying on specialized deep learning frameworks such as TensorFlow or PyTorch. The CNN is implemented using NumPy arrays and includes essential layers such as convolutional layers, pooling layers, and fully connected layers.

Additionally, the repository includes a PyTorch version of the CNN model (_02_PyTorchCNN.ipynb_). This PyTorch implementation leverages the power of the PyTorch framework to train the model on the popular "Cats and Dogs" dataset. The model is designed to classify images of cats and dogs accurately.

Furthermore, the repository offers flexibility for users to test the model with their own custom datasets of cats and dogs (_03_TestModel.ipynb_). By following the provided instructions, users can incorporate their datasets, preprocess the images, and evaluate the performance of the trained CNN model on their unique data.

Whether you are interested in understanding the fundamentals of CNNs through a NumPy implementation, training a CNN model on the "Cats and Dogs" dataset using PyTorch, or exploring the performance on your custom dataset, this repository provides a comprehensive framework to accomplish those tasks.
